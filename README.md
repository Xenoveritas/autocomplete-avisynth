# autocomplete-avisynth package

Provides autocompletion support for AviSynth. This requires the [language-avisynth](https://github.com/Xenoveritas/language-avisynth) package to function.

Note: this version is very simplistic at present, and just autocompletes will
all builtins, regardless of context.
